I'm a physical oceanographer and ocean modeler. I'm currently an Assistant Professor in the [Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences Thrust](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/four-hubs/function-hub/earth-ocean-atmospheric-sciences){:target="_blank"} at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn){:target="_blank"}, or HKUST(GZ) for short, and an Affiliate Assistant Professor in the [Department of Ocean Science](https://oces.hkust.edu.hk){:target="_blank"} at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk){:target="_blank"}. Before joining HKUST(GZ) in 2021, I did my postdoc research in the [Fluid Dynamics and Solid Mechanics](https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/theoretical/fluid-dynamics-solid-mechanics/index.php){:target="_blank"} division at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov){:target="_blank"}, working on the [Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM)](https://e3sm.org){:target="_blank"} project. I received my PhD in 2018 from the [Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences](https://www.brown.edu/academics/earth-environmental-planetary-sciences/){:target="_blank"} at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu){:target="_blank"}, working with [Prof. Baylor Fox-Kemper](http://www.geo.brown.edu/research/Fox-Kemper/){:target="_blank"}. See my PhD dissertation [here](publications.html#pdfthesis). Before that I received a Master's degree in Meteorology and a Bachelor's degree in Atmospheric Sciences from the [Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://www.atmos.pku.edu.cn/en/){:target="_blank"} at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn){:target="_blank"}, working with [Prof. Haijun Yang](https://aos.fudan.edu.cn/72/b0/c14809a225968/page.htm){:target="_blank"}. See more in my [CV](pdf/CV.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
