The poleward transport of the excessive solar energy absorbed at low latitudes in the atmosphere and the ocean largely determines the regional and global climate variability, which strongly shapes our social and economical activities. For my master's degree, I worked on decomposing the meridional heat transport in the climate system, and using climate models to understand the climate variability over the past 22,000 years from the energetic perspective.
