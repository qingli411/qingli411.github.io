Small scale physical processes such as ocean surface boundary layer (OSBL) turbulence are not resolved in climate models, at least not until the end of this century (see Figure&nbsp;1 of [this paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Principles-and-advances-in-subgrid-modelling-for-Fox-Kemper-Bachman/947c0647d365b6b752e3e7b2a7cf055c32fc51e7){:target="_blank"} for how this is estimated). However, their effects on the global climate are significant. I develop physically-based parameterizations to represent the effects of such small scale physical processes in climate models. This figure shows a comparison between 11 OSBL turbulence parameterizations with and without Langmuir turbulence, of which I have contributed three ([KPPLT-VR12](publications.html#li2016ocemod), [KPPLT-LF17](publications.html#li2017jpo) and [ePBL-LT](publications.html#Reichl2019jpo)). See more in paper [[9]](publications.html#li2019james). Many of these parameterizations have been implemented in the Community Ocean Vertical Mixing Project ([CVMix](http://cvmix.github.io){:target="_blank"}) and the General Ocean Turbulence Model ([GOTM](https://gotm.net){:target="_blank"}), which are libraries that can be easily used in many ocean models.
